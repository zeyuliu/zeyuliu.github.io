					Since 1960, US soybean acreage has more than tripled from 24 million acres to over 83 million acres. At the same time, yields per acre have approximately doubled. Many factors contribute to this dramatic rise, but here we will investigate demand-driven growth. Demand is one of the primary motivators for production – increased demand for a product presents a lucrative opportunity for suppliers to ramp up production and reap the profits. In order to identify the source of demand for soybeans, we must examine their place in the modern food system. Consumer products like soymilk, soy sauce, and tofu spring to mind immediately when one thinks of soybeans. Long staples in East Asia, these soy products have gained popularity in the West as well, in part due to the rise of health food, vegetarian, and vegan movements. However, these iconic products are a relatively small portion of the soy crop.

					A large majority of soybeans, about 85%, undergo the process of crushing, which produces soybean meal and soybean oil. Soybean meal is a vital feed in modern animal husbandry, while soybean oil is one of the most prevalent vegetable oils used for cooking and in processed foods. The separation process involves heating, mechanical crushing, and solvent extraction of oils. While the oil content of the beans varies based on growing conditions, each bushel of soybeans produces about 11 to 12 pounds of oil, 44 pounds of meal, and 3 to 4 pounds of hulls. The processing of soybeans can be viewed as a profitable industry in its own right, with firms dedicated to processing raw soybeans into its components. The difference in the price of a bushel of soybeans and the processed products resulting from that bushel varies year to year, but as of 2011 has typically been between 50 cents and $1.50. The margins on this processing hover around 7-10%. 
					<br/><br/>Since 1960, demand for both soybean meal and soybean oil has increased substantially. Soybean meal is a nutritionally dense feed for animals, and a particularly good source of protein. Furthermore, the protein in soybean meal has relatively high bioavailability, and its lysine content (an essential, limiting amino acid for animal growth) allows for formulation of diets lower in total protein. As a result of its many benefits, soybean meal accounts for approximately two thirds of protein-based animal feed. The drastic rise in prevalence of soybean meal as an animal feed began first in the 1970s, and spiked once again in the 1990s. And as industrialized livestock operations have become a larger part of the meat industry over the years, so too has the importance of soybean meal. Nowadays, China is the largest importer of soybeans, as its explosive growth and burgeoning middle class have driven the rise of by far the largest meat industry in the world. And despite a sizable domestic soybean industry in China, it still relies heavily on imports from other producers, including the United States. This, of course, has been a major factor behind the increases in production here in the US.

					Both absolute and per-capita consumption of soybean oil, along with other major vegetable oils such as rapeseed and sunflower seed, rose dramatically in the same period, due in large part to a move away from the ostensibly less healthy saturated fats in animal products like lard and butter. But even amongst its vegetable oil competitors, soybean oil has made remarkable strides. Taking West Germany as an example, soybean oil captured only 20% of the German market share in 1960. Due to advertising campaigns organized by the American Soybean Association, labelling products as containing soybean oil became advantageous. By 1980, soybean oil represented 47% of the German vegetable oil market. In America, soybean oil rose dramatically during World War II, when war with Japan halted the supply of various vegetable oils and oilseeds from Asia. Soybeans gained a newfound status as the go-to oilseed, and soybean oil became the top vegetable oil in the United States by 1944, and has maintained that position since. And overall consumption of soybean oil has risen in the decades since, due both to the aforementioned shift from animal fats to vegetable fats, as well as the increase in consumption of processed foods. 
					Soybean meal’s rise is more recent and more dramatic than soybean oil, but strong demand for both continue to drive the industry.

A facet explaining the rise in soy production over time can be attributed to the increase in access to credit and financial services for producers and buyers of soy. Access to credit plays a critical role in the economic development of an industry over time, as it permits for investment of capital beyond a company’s short-term financing means.
<br/><br/>
Financial institutions lending to soy producers consider various risk factors that influence access to credit, ranging from environmental risk, diversification risk to corporate responsibility (CSR). We will first consider the risk associated with CSR as it pertains to soy, and examine how this mechanism influences soy production from the perspective of credit. 
<br/><br/>
There are various international guidelines that tailor how financial institutions assess companies seeking credit, including but not limited to: the UN Human Rights Norms for Business, OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Global Compact. These guidelines are especially important for commodities, since they encompass broad global supply chains across production, processing, distribution and consumption. 
<br/><br/>

Many key CSR risk components pertain to social issues, and are guided by a socially normative set of principles that strive toward money lending that is highly focused on anti-money laundering and harmful behaviors. These issues that must be assessed through the credit process are: corruption or bribery, human rights and environmental degradation. While this may seem like a positive regulatory step, it is limited within the credit assessment process. There are barriers to knowledge about production that banks have to thoroughly interrogate, and companies that do engage in poor practices may still access credit. This depends upon severity, as well as the level of reputational or regulatory risk an institution may bear if the producer is found to violate the CSR criteria. Here we see an asymmetric information problem associated with access to credit for farmers from financial institutions. 
<br/><br/>
It is important to note that in the United States, there is different incentive for producers of soy when it comes to accessing credit. The price support system for soy producers is robust, and subsequently farmers are able to access credit at a more affordable rate than banks (FSA). This system allows for producer to access relatively cheap debt, but does not necessarily fulfill debt needs for large-scale commodity crops such as soy.

Hedging has played an important role in the rise of commodity crop production, as derivatives markets allow producers and buyers to hedge risk for future crop production. While the complexity of derivatives trading has its own barriers to entry, hedging has impacted farmers from not only a price perspective, but also a labor perspective. Diana Henrique explores how American farmers constantly need to spend excess amounts of time monitoring commodity trading prices to know how much they will be paid for future crops. 
<br/><br/>
This narrative is situated in a global market, as farmers comment that while prices are increasing against growing world demand, the commodity market is still far more volatile than in the past. In 2008, prices for soybeans increased 91 percent, before a long-sustained downward trend. Higher crop insurance premiums are one example of increased cost associated with commodity market volatility, which negatively impacts the farmer, and can eventually impact the consumer. 
<br/><br/>
After discussing with a commodity trader, hedging is a primary financial tool for buyers of commodity products to ensure competitive prices. However, it is difficult to gauge whether the financial mechanisms of the market can exacerbate the volatility or prevent it from worsening.

We must consider how cultural production fits into commodity chain analysis, interrogating the links between markets, consumers and producers. Benjamin Brewer suggests that in order to create a holistic view of commodity chains, we must situate them in historical context, and question how the consumer plays a role in market evolution. The evolution can be traced theoretically through the framework of the division of labor, and the primitive accumulation that follows embedding a market in society through a Polanyian perspective of political economy. 
<br/><br/>
If we question how markets are formed socially, it can better inform how we understand the soy commodity chain from both consumer and produce side, through a sociological lens. Brewer suggests further, that if we consumer the cultural production of commodity markets as an active component of the global system, it may help inform new ideas for the reconstruction of the global economy and food system.
